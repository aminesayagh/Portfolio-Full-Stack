## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website is designed to be a showcase of my work, including projects, blog posts, and other professional information. It is built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

### Components

The components directory contains all the reusable UI components used throughout the application. My approach is based on using an unstyled React component UI library, [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/), which I have styled using Tailwind CSS classes. This approach allows for a unique and consistent style identity while leveraging the functionality provided by React Spectrum components.
